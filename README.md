# Fashion-MNIST-GAN
Example of a simple GAN model using keras.

The generator is trained against the discriminator using the script 'train_generator.py'.
The generator learns to create 28x28 images of clothes and shoes similar to the ones in the [Fashion-MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).
